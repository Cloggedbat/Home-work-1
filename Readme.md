### Purpus

The purpus of this homework was to go in and make the code behind the given web page more ledgable by getting rid of redundent code and fixing code that was not optimized/being used.
    
I have placed notations in my HTML and CSS pages showing my changes. One major change that you will see is that I have added a second styles page to host my images, this was one an easier way to keep track of them and see what they are doing

I used https://validator.w3.org/ to check my work and would sometime be told to eleminate elements that then it would ask me to put back the next time i checked it. One example is it told me that there was and unclosed div so I added a div in the corect location checked and all was good then later it would ask me to eliminate the same div and then ask me to add it again. Is there a better place to check my code?
